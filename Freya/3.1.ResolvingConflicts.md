# 3.1 Resolving conflicts
In Freya your character will often be faced with a situations that can have two or more possible outcomes - we call them **conflicts**.

A conflict is defined by following:
- decriptive narration
- attribute type
- difficulty value
- clear set of outcomes

> You stamble on a loosly rock that happened to triger a trap. Deadly arrow is coming your way.  
Take an *Agility* roll with dificuly value of 3.  
If you fail take a point of damage.
