# 3. Playing the game 

Once your characters are ready - all you need to do is pick up scenario you want to play. 

## What is Scenario? 
Scenario is a single adventure with clear set of objectives that can be either won or lost. Each scenario is defined by custom *map* and carefully constructed *event's deck*. 

**Event's deck** consists multiple event's card that represents active part of scenario. They can be anything from narratives and descriptive events that are meant to set the scene to more direct ones that forces players into conflicts. 

**Map** is a set of location cards that are meant to restrict player to a certain space while playing scenario. Locations may be known upfront or kept hidden - to be revealed in the specific moment during scenario. 

## How to start? 
For each scenario you should follow its own setup description. Typically, you will be instructed how to setup map and events deck. 

Once you have that sorted out - you will follow repeatable, relatively simple order of actions: 

1) reveal single event from event's deck and resolve its effect 
2) resolve players actions
3) resolve non-playable characters (NPCs) actions 

This sequence should be repeated unless: 
- players will met all of scenario's objectives and won, 
- specific event will occurred indicating end of the game or, 
- event's deck will run off of cards or 
- all players will be killed - all meaning defeat. 

## Taking actions
Each character has 2 actions.
- Move to connected location
- Interact with NPC or objects in your location
- Fight
- Use your skills

## We want to have GM!
Optionally **events deck** can be acted out by GM - who should take his turn instead of revealing cards from events deck. You can be ok with letting your GM to do whatever (s)he likes or you can put some constrains with some additional rules.

Possible GM variants
- GM can do what ever (s)he like - including instantly killing you all with a meteor shower
- GM has events deck at disposal - but can only play one card from events deck at the time - during its turn
- GM draw 5 cards on hand - and can only play one card from hand during its turn
