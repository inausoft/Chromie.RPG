# 2. Character creation

Your character will play an important role in every game and as such it should be carefully thinked trought in advance. Every choice will influence your playstyle, game experience and decision options.

Character creation process should roughly look like this:
1. Came up with high concept
2. Pick up fitting origin
3. Choosing right atributes
4. Adjusting skils
5. Choosing name

## High Concept
This is when it all begins. You need to have something to work with, an idea that you and your friends can build upon and evolve - a thought. Dreadful warlock, noble knight, wondering wizard, daring pirate - all would do, all roughly describe what you would like your characters to be and how you would like to play it.
