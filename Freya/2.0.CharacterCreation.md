# 2. Character creation

## Basics
Your characters plays an important role in the story that you are all going to tell and as such it requires a bit of prep - to came up with the right ideas. Thankfully it's the game creator who should prepare some background scenarios for you to choose. All it's left is to pick one that suits you the most. 

Character creation process should look like this:
1. Came up with high concept
2. Pick up fitting origin
3. Choosing right atributes
4. Adjusting skils
5. Choosing name

## High Concept
This is when it all begins. You need to have something to work with, an idea that you and your friends can build upon and evolve - a thought. Dreadful warlock, noble knight, wondering wizard, daring pirate - all would do, all roughly describe what you would like your characters to be.
