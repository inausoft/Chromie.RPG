# 2.1 Origins

All characters are born in the game. They grow, fail and learn long before they are suitable for playing. This goes for your character as well. You need to know where did your character came from and how it fits into existing world - or in other words you need to know your character's origin.

Lucky for you it's actually game (world) designer to came up with all origins and their related stories. Your origin should provide you with few very useful things:

- Theme - good origin is descriptive enough to give you proper indication of how was your character before you started playing it. Take 'Criminal' for example. You already know that your character will be shady, law breaking and possibly cunning.

- Hook - Every origin should came with a 'hook' - story, chapter 0 - that will tie your character to the main plot in a meaningful, personal way.

- Starting skills - all origins brings handful of skills your character acquired while growing up. Although no one will forbid your character to become world's most famous political leader - having 'Noble' as your origin will certainly put you in the right direction from the very beginning.

Typically there should be at least these 5 most archetypical origins available for you to choose:

## Criminal

## Noble

## Outlander


- Apprentice
- Devote
