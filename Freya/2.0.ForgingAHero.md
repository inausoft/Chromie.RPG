# 2. Forging a hero

In Freaya RPG - each player controls a **hero** - carefully designed character defined by set of abilities, skills and equipement. In order to play scenario you have to create one yourself. 

Remember that each choice you will make during creation process is going to influence your playstale and game experience. Also not every combination will be as sussfull as others - so don't expect to get everything right at the first time.

> **Tip**  
> Some scenarios will ofer predefined set of heros. You can chose one of them or treat it as a starting point for customisation.

## Creation process

Character creation process should roughly look like this:
1. Came up with aspiration
2. Choose fitting origin
3. Adjust your abilities scores
4. Pick up the right skils
5. Take a name

## Aspiration
All begins here. If you want to create grate hero - you need to have something to work with, an idea that you and your friends can build upon and evolve - an aspiration. *Dreadful warlock*, *noble knight*, *wondering wizard*, *daring pirate* - all would do, all roughly describe what you would like your characters to be and how you would like to play it.
