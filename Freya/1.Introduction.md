# 1. Welcome to Freya RPG System

## Basics
If you've never played RPG game before - the main idea is to seat down with a group of friends and tell an interactive story in which you all are heroic adventurers that combines their skills to overcome any challenges that the game can throw at you.

Freya System is design with table top experience in mind - meaning it is different than other RPG systems mainly because you don't need a game master (GM) or at least not during the game itself. It can however enhance your experience and bring lots of fun to the table!

## What you need to play?

- **Freya dice** - it's carefully designed 12 sided die - if you don't have one you can download simple app.
- **2 - 5 people** - with an optional game master **(+GM?)**.
- **Character sheets** - one for each player.
- **Scenario** - you can download one - or came up with your own story.
