## **3.2 Resolving events**
At the begining of each round players must reveal single event card from event deck and resolve it's effect.

Typically an event card will introduce new narration and a associated ability test.

> **Example**  
'*Distant voices begins to echo in your heads causing waves of unberable pain.*' Take a Personality test with difficulty of 4. If you fail take 1 wound.

### Teast your ability
Whenever your hero will be engage in a Ability Test he needs to make a dice roll. Each test will have one accosiated ability meaning heroes will add their maching ability bonus to the roll, as well as thay can commit their skills with maching ability. For each maching ability hero can add +1 to final output.

>**Example**  
Jim's hero needs to get at least 4 on it's Personality test to avoid being hurt. Hero's Personality is 4, but Jim's decide to use Bravery skill adding +1 value to the test's outcome. Than Jim rolls the dices and get -1 value. Test's output is 4 = 4 (hero's Personality) + 1 (Bravery) - 1 (dices roll).

Here you can see descriptions of tests dificulty values:

| Difficulty | Value |
|:----------:|:-----:|
|  very easy |   2   |
|    easy    |   3   |
|   medium   |   4   |
|    hard    |   5   |
|  very hard |   6   |

## **3.3 Taking actions**
Once an event effect is resolved it is heros time to take actions. Each hero can take two actions, and the order in which heroes are taking their actions is irreleveant as long as both available actions are taken one after another.

In it's turn hero can:
- move
- use an item
- use a skill
- investigate secret
- interact with NPC
- rest

### Movement
As long as there are no hostile characters in the hero's location hero can freely move to a connection location as one action, otherwise hero success depends on a Agility test. Difficulty of the test is calculated as higest Agility value among all hostile creatures plus the number of these characters.

> **Example**  
Jim's hero is bearly alive and there are 2 giant rats in his location. Jim decides that it would be best for his hero to leave this location so he need to make an Agility test. Since Giant Rat agility value is 3 and there are 2 hostile characters in the location difficulty of the test is 5. Jim's rolled +2 combining with his hero's agility of 3 makes a total of 5 which indicates success - his hero left his current location.
