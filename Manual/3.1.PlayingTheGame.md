## 3.4 Round sequence

Playing the scenario is all about following these repeatable, relatively simple order of actions: 

1) Events Phase - reveal single event from event's deck and resolve its effect 
2) Hero Phase - resolve players actions
3) Environmnet Phase - resolve non-playable characters (NPCs) actions 

All above actions resolved in this order is called a *round*.  You will play new rounds unless given scenario is either won or lost.

## 3.5 Events Phase
At the begining of each round players must reveal single event card from event deck and they all must resolve it's effect.

Typically an event card will introduce new narration and a associated ability test.

> **Example**  
'*Distant voices begins to echo in your heads causing waves of unberable pain.*' Take a *personality* test with difficulty of 4. If you fail take 1 wound.

### Skill tests
Each test has a accosiated skill and assigned difficuly value. To perform a *skill test* player needs to roll a dice that acts as a modifier for hero's original skill value. If the modified value is equal or grater than test's difficulty 
test ends with success.

Before rolling the dice hero can boost tested skill using his talents.

>**Example**  
Jim's hero needs to get at least 4 on it's *personality test* to avoid being hurt. Hero's personality is 4 and Jim's decide to use Bravery talent to boost his hero's personality by 1. Than Jim rolls the dices and gets -1. Test's output is 4 = 4 (hero's Personality) + 1 (Bravery) - 1 (dices roll) indicating hero's success.

Here you can see descriptions of tests dificulty values:

| Difficulty | Value | Chances |
|:----------:|:-----:|:-------:|
|  very easy |   1   |   ~83%  |
|    easy    |   2   |   ~60%  |
|   medium   |   3   |   ~50%  |
|    hard    |   4   |   ~33%  |
|  very hard |   5   |   ~17%  |
|    epic    |   6   |   ~8%   |

## 3.6 Taking actions

Once an event effect is resolved it is heros time to take actions. Each hero can spent two actions. Turn order is irrelevant as long as both actions are taken one after another.

In it's turn hero can:
- move
- use an item
- use a skill
- investigate secret
- interact with NPC
- rest

### Movement
As long as there are no hostile characters in the hero's location hero can freely move to a connection location as one action, otherwise hero success depends on a Agility test. Difficulty of the test is calculated as higest Agility value among all hostile creatures plus the number of these characters.

> **Example**  
Jim's hero is bearly alive and there are 2 giant rats in his location. Jim decides that it would be best for his hero to leave this location so he need to make an Agility test. Since Giant Rat agility value is 3 and there are 2 hostile characters in the location difficulty of the test is 5. Jim's rolled +2 combining with his hero's agility of 3 makes a total of 5 which indicates success - his hero left his current location.
