In Freya your character will often be faced with a situations that can have two or more possible outcomes - we call them **conflicts**.

A conflict is defined by following:
- decriptive narration
- test type
- difficulty value
- clear set of outcomes

> You've stambled on a loosly rock that happened to triger a trap. Deadly arrow is coming your way.  
You have to take an *Agility* test with dificuly value of 4.  
If you fail take a point of damage.

## Roll it bebe!
If the conflict requires you to test one of your attributes - you need to roll Freya dice (dF). Typically the challange will have a difficulty number that you need to even to succes. The formula for it is:

*Tested Attribute* + dF + skills >= difficuly value

> Freya diceis 12 sided dice with the following symbols: -3 -2 -1 -1 0 0 +1 +1 +2 *scull* *fate*

> Joe's character has it's *Agility* value of 3. Because test difficulty is 4 - in order to succed he needs to roll +1 or better. Dice showed +2 making Joe's character passed the test - bearly avoding upcoming arrow.
