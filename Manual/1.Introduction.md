## Basics
If you've never played RPG game before - the main idea is to seat down with a group of friends and tell an interactive story in which you are all heroic adventurers that combines their skills to overcome any challenges that the game can throw at you.

**Freya RPG** was especially design to:
- **be simple** - there are lots of complicated RPG systems out there, with Freya the only thing you need to start is to have postitive atitude.

- **bring table top experience** - Freya is different than other RPG systems mainly because there is a board and there is no need for game master (GM) or at least not during the game itself. It can however enhance your experience and bring lots of fun to the table!

## What you need to play?
