# 3. Playing the game

## 3.1 Key concepts
Once your heros are ready - all you need to do is pick up scenario you want to play. 

### Scenario
*Scenario* is a single adventure thay may or may not be part of a larger campaign, designed with clear set of objectives. Each scenario has its own *map* and carefully constructed *event's deck*. 

### Event's deck
*Event's deck* consists of multiple event's card that represents active part of scenario. They can be anything from narratives and descriptive events that are meant to set the scene to more direct events that forces players into *skil tests*.

### Map
*Map* is a set of location cards that are meant to restrict player to a certain space while playing scenario. Locations may be known upfront or kept hidden - to be revealed in the specific moment during scenario.

## 3.2 How to start  
For each scenario you should follow its own setup description. Typically, you will be instructed how to setup map and events deck. 

## 3.3 Wining and losing
As you progress trough scenario you schould look for an indication of win. You can find it while solving particular mystery or defeating enemy.

You need to bare in mind that once you reveal last event card it will typicaly inform you about your defeat or instruct you to move to the next scenario with significant disadvantages at the very begining.
