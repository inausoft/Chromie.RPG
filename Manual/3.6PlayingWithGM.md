## 3.6 We want to have GM!
Optionally **events deck** can be acted out by GM - who should take his turn instead of revealing cards from events deck. You can be ok with letting your GM to do whatever (s)he likes or you can put some additional constrains with these possible GM variants:

- GM can do what ever (s)he like - including instantly killing you all with a meteor shower,
- GM has events deck at disposal - but can only play one card from events deck at the time - during its turn,
- GM draw 5 cards on hand - and can only play one card from hand during its turn.
