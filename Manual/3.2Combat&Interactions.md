# Combat & Interactions

## Combat

If your hero is in the same location as one other (or more) characters and (s)he has a *weapon item* in the inventory - you can use it to invoke *Combat test* against one of the characters in your hero's location other than yourself.

### Wepon item

Each weapon item will have followig properties:
- associated ability (ability - most often strength - used for the test)
- specified range (some range weapons will allow you to invoke *combat test* against character in connected location)
- damage output

> Dagger: *Choose a character in your location. Fight (agility). If you succed deal 1 damage.*

*Fight* action will require you to make a associated ability test with all bonuses your hero can benefit from during a *Fight* action. Test difficulty is based on a target *agility* score.
