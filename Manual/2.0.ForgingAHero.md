# 2. Forging a hero

In Freaya RPG - each player controls a *hero* - carefully designed character defined by set of skills and talents. You need to have one - either created by yourself or picked up from a predefined set before you can start playing.

This chapter will guide you trough character creation process. Remember that each choice you will make is going to influence your playstale and game experience. Also not every build will be as successful as others - so don't expect to get everything right at the very first time.

### Follow those steps to create your hero:

1. Came up with an aspiration
3. Choose fitting origin
4. Adjust your skills
5. Pick up the right talents
6. Take a name

## 2.1 Aspiration

All begins here. If you want to create truly great hero - you need to have something to work with, an idea that you and your friends can build upon and evolve - an aspiration. *Dreadful warlock*, *noble knight*, *wondering wizard* or *daring pirate* - all would do, all roughly describe who would you like your hero to be, and how you would like to play it.
