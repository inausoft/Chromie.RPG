# 2. Forging a hero

In Freaya RPG - each player controls a **hero** - carefully designed character defined by set of abilities and skills. In order to play you need to have one - either created by yourself or picked up from predefined set.

Remember that each choice you will make during creation process is going to influence your playstale and game experience. Also not every combination will be as successful as others - so don't expect to get everything right at the very first time.

## Creation process

Character creation process should roughly look like this:
1. Came up with an aspiration
3. Choose fitting origin
4. Adjust your abilities scores
5. Pick up the right skills
6. Take a name

## Aspiration
All begins here. If you want to create truly great hero - you need to have something to work with, an idea that you and your friends can build upon and evolve - an aspiration. *Dreadful warlock*, *noble knight*, *wondering wizard* or *daring pirate* - all would do, all roughly describe who would you like your hero to be, and how you would like to play it.
