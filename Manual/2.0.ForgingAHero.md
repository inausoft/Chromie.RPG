# 2. Forging a hero

In Freaya RPG - each player controls a **hero** - carefully designed character defined by set of aspects. You need to have one - either created yourself or picked up from a predefined set - before you can actually start playing.

This chapter will guide you trough hero creation process. Remember that each choice you will make is going to influence your play style and game experience. Also not every build will be as successful as others - so don't expect to get everything right at the very first time.

### Follow those steps to create your hero:

1. Came up with an aspiration
2. Pick up right aspects
3. Choose fitting origin
4. Take a name

## 2.1 Health and Effort

### Health
Health indicates how tought given character is. If for whatever reason character's health will drop to 0 - it is considered dead and can no longer taking actions unless resurected.

Each character starts with 5 health - which can be modified with deifferent aspects.

### Effort Points
Effort points indicates characters readiness for actions. These points are typically trade for invoking aspects and their related actions. The less effort points a character has - the more tired it is.



## 2.2 Came up with an aspiration

All begins here. If you want to create truly deep and interesting hero - you need to have something to work with, an idea that you and your friends can build upon and evolve - an aspiration. 
- dreadful warlock, 
- noble knight, 
- wondering wizard,
- political leader, 
- deadly assasin,
- space pillot
 
all are grate examples of an aspiration, all roughly describe who would you like your hero to be, and how you would like to play it.

## 2.3 Pick up your aspects

In Freya - everything that is out of the ordinary is described with appropriate aspects. An aspect is a descriptive word (or phrase) that can be invoke to either increase or decrease hero's chances of being sucessfull in a given action, or to invoke action itself.



Aspects can be assigned to anything, including: characters, monsters, items and locations.

### Basic Aspects

## 2.4 Choose your origin

All characters are born in game. They grow, fail and learn long before you can actualy play them. This goes for your hero as well. You need to know where did your hero came from and how it fits into existing world - or in the other words you need to know its origin.

Lucky (or not) for you it's actually scenario (campaign) designer (or GM) who should have came up with all origins and their related stories in adavance - leaving you with some conrete options. 

> In some cases players might sway their GM to adjust background of one of the origings - but in most predefined campaigns provided story line might not be flexible enought to allow that.

While choosing your hero's origin you should look for:

- **Theme** - good origin is descriptive enough to give you proper indication of who was your character before you started playing it. Take 'Criminal' for example. You already know that your character grew up as shady, law breaking and possibly cunning.

- **Hook** - origin should came with a 'hook' - scenario, chapter 0 - that will tie your character to the main plot in a meaningful, personal way.

- **Starting aspects** - all origins brings handful of aspects that your character aquired while growing up. Although no one will forbid your character to become world's most famous political leader - having 'Noble' as your origin will certainly put you on the right track from the very beginning.

- **Trouble** - a flow, bad reputation or nemesis - something that will fallow your character from the day one - now and than causing unexpected problems.

- **Starting equipment** - each origin will provide you with handfull of usefull starting items.

Typical origins that should always be provided regarless of the type and setting of a campaign are:

## Solider
